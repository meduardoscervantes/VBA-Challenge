# VBA-Challenge

This repository contains three photos and a .bas file

The .bas file is a macro from excel VBA. The macro will loop through the workbook sheets and generate information about each ticker in each sheet.
The macro calculates the total volume, yearly percentage change, and the yearly price change. It will also find the largest positive and negative
percentage change from the sheet. Furthermore, it will find the ticker with the largest total volume in the worksheet.

The three photos are images of the different sheets from a workbook. The images show the final output from the macro in action.
